# Python-CS
Computer Science lessons using Python

## What is this?
This is a collection of lessons designed to let students and teachers new to
Python explore the language in a comfortable, guided-but-exploratory
environment. The lessons have some overlapping skills, and there's not right or
wrong order to their undertaking.

## Whom is this for?
These lessons are written with teachers in mindâ€”specifically, teachers who are
unfamiliar with Python, and perhaps with programming entirely. No prior
knowledge is necessary to get going with these lessons.

## What *will* I need?
The lessons are designed for use with the [IDLE](http://python.org)
environment, so go get that. And, of course, I recommend using a GNU/Linux
operating system, but any \*Nix-flavored OS will do. I suppose Windows would be
fine. I honestly haven't ever run Python on Windows.

A nice text editor like [Atom](http://atom.io) might be helpful as well. This
project was written in it!

## How do I use these lessons?
You, the teacher, should read the `lesson.md` file in each lesson directory.
Inside, you'll find instructional guidelines based on an Understanding-by-Design
model. You'll also find some suggestions on how to introduce these projects to
students.

I recommend **not** showing the provided code files to your students until
*after* you've set the tasks laid out in the files and let your students work
on them for a while. Use the examples to guide and "unstick" your students.
Don't give them the answers.
