# RPS

In this lesson, students will use Python to create a rock, paper, scissors game in which they play against the computer.

## Essential Questions

* How do computers generate random choices?
* When should a program use functions?
* How do I consider my user when I write my code?

## Resources

* Python v.3.x
* IDLE or Terminal

## Skills

* Importing modules
* Nested conditionals
* Functional structure
* Dictionaries


## Instructional suggestions

Begin with a simple lesson on random numbers. Perhaps use the Python shell to run:

    import random
    random.random()

Run that a few times and discuss what `random()` actually does. Afterwards, maybe try `random.randint(0,11)` and discuss.

As always, don't forget to use the [Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org) liberally when you don't understand something. Learning to read code documentation is a skill that needs to be reinforced throughout these lessons.
